<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Each year Jesus&rsquo; family would make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover with family and friends.&nbsp; This year was special because at age 12, Jesus could ask questions and interact with the religious leaders of His day.&nbsp; Luke 2:40 summarizes Jesus&rsquo; boyhood until age 12.&nbsp; Luke 2:52 summarizes his growth toward manhood which covers the time at approximately age 18 until he was about 30.</p>
