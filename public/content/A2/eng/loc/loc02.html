<h3>The Word Became Flesh</h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Read Philippians 2:5-11.&nbsp; God almighty took on human form.&nbsp; He chose to begin as a baby and not as a grown man.&nbsp; The bible says that He &ldquo;made himself nothing&rdquo; and put on a body to live here with us.&nbsp; However, He never ceased to be fully God.&nbsp; He was still all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present.&nbsp; Yet He veiled His deity and intentionally limited Himself and His powers to become a real human.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Who, being in very nature God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;<br />
<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>rather, he made himself nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by taking the very nature of a servant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being made in human likeness.<br />
<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>And being found in appearance as a man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he humbled himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by becoming obedient to death&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even death on a cross!</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave him the name that is above every name,<br />
<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br />
<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the glory of God the Father.</p>
