Because I live, you also will live. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;20</sup>On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;21</sup>Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.”</p><p><sup class="versenum">22</sup>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”</p><p><sup class="versenum">23</sup>Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;24</sup>Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching.

I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</p></p>

<p>The most important thing will be how we apply what we learn, and so we want to help each other find ways to do that. Some questions to help us do that:</p>
<div class="forward-action">
<ol start = "13" class="ol-forward">
<li>How could this or does this change how you will live? With God, self and others?</li>
<li>What is one thing you would like to apply to your life from this week's discussion? What will you do to make that change?</li>
<li>With whom will you share what you learned this week? What will you share?</li>
</ol>

<span class="eng-verse">Galatians 5:16-26</span>
</p>
<div class="bible">
<p><p><sup class="versenum">16</sup>So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;17</sup>For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;18</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</p><p><sup class="versenum">19</sup>The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;20</sup>idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;21</sup>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p><p><sup class="versenum">22</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;23</sup>gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;24</sup>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;25</sup>Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;26</sup>Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.</p></p>

In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;12</sup>What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;13</sup>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;14</sup>The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;15</sup>The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;16</sup>for,</p><div class="poetry top-05"><p>“Who has known the mind of the Lord<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so as to instruct him?”</p></div><p>But we have the mind of Christ.</p><p><sup class="versenum">1</sup>Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;2</sup>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;3</sup>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</p></p>
