I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</p><p><sup class="versenum">22</sup>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;23</sup>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. <sup class="versenum">&nbsp;24</sup>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</p></p>

<p class="text-conclusion top">Confession is simply telling God that you’ve done the wrong thing by him and asking him to forgive you. God promises that if we do confess our sin, that he will forgive our sin.</p>
<p class="text-conclusion">By turning back to God and away from your sin, you will experience his love and forgiveness that was provided by Jesus’ death on the cross. Instead of guilt, condemnation and punishment, your fellowship (closeness) with God will be restored.</p>

<p>The most important thing will be how we apply what we learn, and so we want to help each other find ways to do that. Some questions to help us do that:</p>
<div class="forward-action">
<ol start = "13" class="ol-forward">
<li>How could this or does this change how you will live? With God, self and others?</li>
<li>What is one thing you would like to apply to your life from this week's discussion? What will you do to make that change?</li>
<li>With whom will you share what you learned this week? What will you share?</li>
