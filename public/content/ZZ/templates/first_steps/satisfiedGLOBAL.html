2. Am I ready now to confess my sins? (1 John 1:9) Sin grieves God's Spirit (Ephesians 4:30).<br />
<br/>
But God in His love has forgiven all your sins - past, present, and future - because Christ has died for you.<br/>
3. Do I sincerely desire to be directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit? (John 7:37-39)</p>

A suggested prayer:</h2>
<blockquote>
Dear Father, I need You. I acknowledge that I have sinned against You by directing my own life. I thank You that You have forgiven my sin through Christ's death on the cross for me.  I now invite Christ to again take His place on the throne of my life.  Fill me with the Holy Spirit as You commanded me to be filled, and as You promised in Your Word that You would do if I asked in faith. I pray this in the name of Jesus. I now thank You for filling me with the Holy Spirit and directing my life.</blockquote>

How to know...</h2>
<p class = "satisfied">
...that you are filled by the Holy Spirit</p>
<p class = "satisfied">
- Did you ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit?<br/>

An important reminder:</i>
</strong>
</p>
<h2 class = "satisfied">
Do not depend on feelings</h2>
<p class = "satisfied">
The promise of God's Word, the Bible - not our feelings - is our authority.  The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word.</p>
<p class = "satisfied">
Flying in an airplane can illustrate the relationship among fact (God and His Word), faith (our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience). (John 14:21)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 class = "satisfied">
Trust facts not feelings</h2>
<figure>
<div class=thumbnail>
<img src="/images/firststeps/Plane.png"/>
</div>
</figure>
<p class = "satisfied">
To be transported by an airplane, we must place our faith in the trustworthiness of the aircraft and the pilot who flies it. Our feelings of confidence or fear do not affect the ability of the airplane to transport us, though they do affect how much we enjoy the trip.</p>
<p class = "satisfied">
In the same way, we as Christians do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.</p>
