          To stop evil from spreading uncontrollably, as was the case before the
          flood, God set boundaries to keep individualism and egotism in check.
          The most important rules are called the “Ten Commandments”. These
          rules help us to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable
          behavior. They are the basis for punishing mistakes to prevent evil
          from spreading unhindered and infecting the whole human race.
