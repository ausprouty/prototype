      <p class="myfriends-reference">Genesis 6:5-22</p>
      <p>
        <sup>5</sup>The
        <span class="small-caps">Lord </span>saw how great the
        wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every
        inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the
        time.<sup >6</sup>The
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was
        deeply troubled.<sup >7</sup>So the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have
        created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move
        along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.”<sup >
          8
        </sup>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >9</sup>
        <span class="normal">This is the account of Noah and his family.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he
        walked faithfully with God.<sup >10</sup>Noah
        had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >11</sup>Now the earth was corrupt in
        God’s sight and was full of violence.<sup >
          12
        </sup>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on
        earth had corrupted their ways.<sup >13</sup>So
        God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth
        is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy
        both them and the earth.<sup >14</sup>So make
        yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch
        inside and out.<sup >15</sup>This is how you
        are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty
        cubits wide and thirty cubits high.<sup >
          16
        </sup>Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit
        high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower,
        middle and upper decks.<sup >17</sup>I am
        going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the
        heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on
        earth will perish.<sup >18</sup>But I will
        establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your
        sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.<sup >
          19
        </sup>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male
        and female, to keep them alive with you.<sup >
          20
        </sup>Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every
        kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept
        alive.<sup >21</sup>You are to take every kind
        of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for
        them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >22</sup>Noah did everything just as God
        commanded him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="myfriends-reference">Genesis 7</p>
      <p>
        <sup >1</sup>The
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because
        I have found you righteous in this generation.<sup >
          2
        </sup>Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male
        and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and
        its mate,<sup >3</sup>and also seven pairs of
        every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive
        throughout the earth.<sup >4</sup>Seven days
        from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights,
        and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have
        made.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >5</sup>And Noah did all that the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        commanded him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >6</sup>Noah was six hundred years old
        when the floodwaters came on the earth.<sup >
          7
        </sup>And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the
        ark to escape the waters of the flood.<sup >
          8
        </sup>Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures
        that move along the ground,<sup >9</sup>male
        and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.<sup >
          10
        </sup>And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >11</sup>In the six hundredth year of
        Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all
        the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the
        heavens were opened.<sup >12</sup>And rain
        fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >13</sup>On that very day Noah and his
        sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his
        three sons, entered the ark.<sup >14</sup>They
        had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock
        according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground
        according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything
        with wings.<sup >15</sup>Pairs of all
        creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered
        the ark.<sup >16</sup>The animals going in
        were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah.
        Then the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>
        shut him in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >17</sup>For forty days the flood kept
        coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark
        high above the earth.<sup >18</sup>The waters
        rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the
        surface of the water.<sup >19</sup>They rose
        greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire
        heavens were covered.<sup >20</sup>The waters
        rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.
        <sup >21</sup>Every living thing that moved on
        land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that
        swarm over the earth, and all mankind.<sup >
          22
        </sup>Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils
        died.<sup >23</sup>Every living thing on the
        face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures
        that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only
        Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >24</sup>The waters flooded the earth for
        a hundred and fifty days.

      <div class="background-text">Genesis 6:5-7:24</div>
      <div class="background-text">
        <div class="background-text">
          The extreme effects of the events in the garden of Eden were gradually
          becoming visible. In just the course of a few generations, evil
          increased so much that by the tenth generation humans were full of
          evil.
        </div>
        <div class="background-text">
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the second generation of humans’ individualism and egotism and
              envy, in short sin, was already so advanced that Cain murdered his
              younger brother. He was expelled from his family as a punishment.
              To ensure that Cain, who now had no family and who was thus
              vulnerable, would not be robbed and murdered by anyone, they
              agreed that he would be avenged seven times. That meant that if
              someone killed Cain, seven people would be executed as a
              punishment&nbsp; (Genesis 4:8-15).
            </li>
            <li>
              In the seventh generation, Lamech killed people for a bruise and
              demanded that he should be avenged not merely seven times as Cain
              had been but seventy seven times (Genesis 4:23-24).
            </li>
            <li>
              By the tenth generation (Noah‘s generation), it needed to be said
              that the wickedness of humans was GREAT. So great, that they could
              only do evil (Genesis 6:11-12). Therefore God decided to intervene
              dramatically in the history of the world to check that evil by
              only allowing what was good to survive the flood and thus make way
              for a new beginning (Genesis 6 and 7).
