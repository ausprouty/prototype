      <p>
        <sup >1</sup>Now the serpent was more crafty
        than any of the wild animals the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat
        from any tree in the garden’?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >2</sup>The woman said to the serpent,
        “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,<sup >
          3
        </sup>but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in
        the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >4</sup>“You will not certainly die,” the
        serpent said to the woman.<sup >5</sup>“For
        God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you
        will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >6</sup>When the woman saw that the fruit
        of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also
        desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave
        some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.<sup >
          7
        </sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they
        were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >8</sup>Then the man and his wife heard
        the sound of the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid
        from the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        among the trees of the garden.<sup >9</sup>But
        the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        called to the man, “Where are you?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >10</sup>He answered, “I heard you in the
        garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >11</sup>And he said, “Who told you that
        you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to
        eat from?”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >12</sup>The man said, “The woman you put
        here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >13</sup>Then the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”
      </p>
      <p>The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”</p>
      <p>
        <sup >14</sup>So the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        said to the serpent, “Because you have done this,
      </p>
      <div class="myfriends-poetry top-05">
        <p>
          “Cursed are you above all livestock<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          all wild animals!<br />You will crawl on your belly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          you will eat dust<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of your
          life.<br />
          <sup >15</sup>And I will put enmity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between
          you and the woman,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and between your
          offspring and hers;<br />he will crush your head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          you will strike his heel.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <sup >16</sup>To the woman he said,
      </p>
      <div class="myfriends-poetry top-05">
        <p>
          “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with
          painful labor you will give birth to children.<br />Your desire will
          be for your husband,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will rule
          over you.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <sup >17</sup>To Adam he said, “Because you
        listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I
        commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’
      </p>
      <div class="myfriends-poetry top-05">
        <p>
          “Cursed is the ground because of you;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through
          painful toil you will eat food from it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all
          the days of your life.<br />
          <sup >18</sup>It will produce thorns and
          thistles for you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will eat the
          plants of the field.<br />
          <sup >19</sup>By the sweat of your brow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you
          will eat your food<br />until you return to the ground,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since
          from it you were taken;<br />for dust you are<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
          to dust you will return.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <sup >20</sup>Adam named his wife Eve, because
        she would become the mother of all the living.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >21</sup>The
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.<sup >
          22
        </sup>And the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        said, “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He
        must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of
        life and eat, and live forever.”<sup >
          23
        </sup>So the
        <span class="small-caps">Lord God</span>
        banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he
        had been taken.<sup >24</sup>After he drove
        the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim
        and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree
        of life.

    <div class="background-text">
      <div class="background-text">Genesis 3</div>
      <div class="background-text">
        Before we get into the tragedy of this chapter, let‘s take a look at an
        important point in the story. Adam and Eve heard God walking in the
        garden. They immediately knew that it was God who was approaching. It
        did not seem to be extraordinary that God walked in the garden with them
        and that they spoke together. The relationship between humans and God
        must have been straightforward and wonderful. How dramatically did that
        change when Adam and Eve suddenly had to choose between the snake and
        God. The snake advised them to eat from the tree of the knowledge of
        good and evil. But after eating from it, they had an even bigger
        problem. They knew that God would come to them in the garden that
        evening. What should they do? The man decided to blame the woman and the
        woman decided to blame the snake. That was the beginning of
        individualism and egotism. They started to think of themselves as
        individuals instead of as a unit of man and woman. They stared to
        distance themselves from each other. That‘s why they made clothes from
        leaves. This just reflected what had already happened in their hearts.
        They drew a line between themselves, to protect themselves from each
        other and they both hid themselves from God too. Humans had only known
        goodness and lived in a wonderful relationship with God and with each
        other. By eating the forbidden fruit, they discovered evil and its
        consequences. In due course humans were driven out of the garden and
        thus out of God‘s presence. The snake‘s advice was not completely wrong.
        They did not die immediately, but were severed from God, the source of
        life, and therefore became mortal. Sadly, from that point onwards, not
        only humans, but the whole of creation fell under the influence of
        death, therefore some animals had to die to provide humans with clothes.
        Through that single action of human opposition towards God, all
        relationships were marred. The relationship to God was marred, the
        relationship between humans was marred and the relationship of humans
        towards nature and animals was marred.
