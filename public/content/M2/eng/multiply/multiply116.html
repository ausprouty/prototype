<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">One day Jesus sent out His followers to minister to people in the surrounding villages. <br />
When they returned they were so excited about all that God had done through them, “Lord, even the demons obey us when we use your name!” After Jesus celebrated with them, He gave them this perspective: “But don’t rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven.” (Luke 10:17-20) Jesus reminds us that our joy is not found in results but that we know Him! </p>

</div>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">The early church was committed to one another. They were meeting together regularly, and many new people were coming to Christ. After a time of persecution, they prayed for boldness and the Lord helped them speak the gospel boldly. This story about the believers in Jerusalem shows their commitment to one another. </p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p class="up">Read or <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/book-of-acts.html/the-believers-share-their-possessions/english.html" target="_blank">watch</a> <strong>Acts 4:32-37</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Even from the beginning of the church, the believers cared for one another’s needs by giving. We learn from this story that we should give willingly, not under compulsion. This is clearly stated in 2 Corinthians 9:7. Read Acts 11:27-29. The early church also gave to believers in other churches. This shows us that our giving can be used for needs outside of our own church. Read Luke 8:1-3. This story shows us that giving is also used for taking the gospel to other places and spread God’s message. In 1 Corinthians 16:2, Paul encourages people to practice giving each week to be used for these purposes. </p>
