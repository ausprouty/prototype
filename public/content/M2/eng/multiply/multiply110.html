<h2 class="back">Praise</h2>

<p class="back">Read Romans 11:33-36 and sing 1-2 songs.</p>

<h2 class="back">Caring for each other</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>What is one highlight from this week?</li>
	<li>What is one challenge from this past week?</li>
	<li>What do you want Jesus to do for you this week?</li>
	<li>Pray for each other’s needs.
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Celebrating God's Faithfulness</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals and <i>I will</i> statements?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">God changes lives and uses them for His glory. One example is the story of a middle eastern man named Adam. He was trained to be a martyr for his religion. But all of that changed one night when he dramatically met Christ. He was so excited about his new relationship to Christ, he began to witness to all of those he knew. Despite being persecuted, he continues to share the gospel and train others. Encourage them by reading 1 Corinthians 1:24-31. </p>

</div>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus challenged four men to follow Him and learn to fish for men. As Jesus was training his followers to fish for men, he modelled six different situations to them. The last situation was to an unlikely government official who would join the four men and become one of Jesus’ closest followers. .</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p class="up">Read or watch <strong>Luke 5:27-32 </strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>27 </sup>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him,<sup class="versenum">28 </sup>and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.

<p><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.<sup class="versenum">30 </sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.<sup class="versenum">32 </sup>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</p>

	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Read Luke 10:1-11. Jesus sent out his followers to do the same things he had been doing: praying for people, caring for their needs and sharing about the Kingdom. This can be summarized as Prayer, Care, Share. He multiplied himself by training and sending out new workers. The Person of Peace is a God- prepared person who will receive you and your message. Through their relationships, they open new networks of people to the gospel. </p>
