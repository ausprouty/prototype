<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>Romans 12:2 encourages us to have our minds renewed with God&rsquo;s truth so that we can be transformed. &nbsp;A huge part of this renewing is coming to understand our new identity now that we are alive in Christ. &nbsp;It is both freeing and empowering to know the truth about how God sees us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection is incredibly significant and powerful in being able to not only save us, but transform us. &nbsp; When His precious Holy Spirit fills us, we are changed in so many ways. &nbsp;Today we will learn how our identity has changed now that we are alive in Christ. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or watch <strong>Romans 8:9-17&nbsp;</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible"><!-- begin bible -->
<div class="bible"><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>How amazing is the new identity that Jesus has given us by His Spirit living inside of us! &nbsp;Our sinful nature has been put to death with Jesus on the cross, so that through His resurrected Spirit we can be transformed. &nbsp;He gives us His righteousness (right standing before God), transforms our nature, enables us to walk in Spirit of life and peace, and gives us the right to be called children of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<li class="forward">Ephesians 2:6</li>
	<li class="forward">Ephesians 2:19-20</li>
	<li class="forward">Ephesians 4:24</li>
