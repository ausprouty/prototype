<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">During a Jewish feast called Pentecost, Jews from all over the world were in Jerusalem. God sent the Holy Spirit on 120 of His followers who had gathered together. Through the Spirit’s power, the 120 followers began speaking in the languages of the visitors from all over the world. Peter began preaching to a crowd about the death and resurrection of Jesus, proving He was the Messiah. As a result, 3,000 people believed and were baptized. But what came next after they believed? </p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p class="up">Read or <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/book-of-acts.html/the-fellowship-of-the-believers/english.html" target="_blank">watch</a> <strong>Acts 2:41-47 </strong>two times as everyone listens</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Read Matthew 16:18. The Holy Spirit led the early believers to meet together regularly for worship, prayer, fellowship, study of God’s word, loving one another and reaching out to those who did not yet know Christ. In every location of the book of Acts, people became followers of Christ and they made this same commitment to one another. This is a description of a local church! </p>
