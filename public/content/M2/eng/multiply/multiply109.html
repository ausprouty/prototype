<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">The first words of Jesus in Mark were telling people to “repent.” This means to change our whole way of thinking because God’s ways are so different from ours. One area is how we view ourselves. We need a new understanding of life with God and what He can do in our lives. The next words of Jesus were "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men." Every disciple of Jesus is called to live out this twin call to follow Him and fish for men. Our sacrificial commitment to Jesus transforms daily life and all our relationships. Let’s encourage each other to continually repent, follow and fish!</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">A couple of weeks before Jesus’ death, He and His followers were in a town called Jericho. As they left to travel the 24 km up the mountain to Jerusalem, a blind man calls out to Jesus trying to get his attention. This story tells us what happened next.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or <a href="https://vimeo.com/162977296">watch</a> <strong>Luke 18:35-43 </strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>35 </sup>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.<sup class="versenum">36 </sup>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.<sup class="versenum">37 </sup>They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”

<p><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,<sup class="versenum">41 </sup>“What do you want me to do for you?”</p>

<p>“Lord, I want to see,” he replied.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">42 </sup>Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”<sup class="versenum">43 </sup>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</p>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus has great compassion for people! He asked the blind man an amazing question, “What do you want me to do for you?” Then He met the man’s needs. In John 14:12-13 Jesus said, “Whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” As followers of Jesus, we take the initiative to show compassion for people in the power of the Spirit by asking people the same Amazing Question and by meeting their needs in practical ways.</p>
