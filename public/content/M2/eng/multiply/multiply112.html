<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p><span class="back">In the book of Acts, we see how believers trained others to be trainers of others. One of the first followers of Jesus was a man named Barnabas. He found a new believer named Paul and helped him. Paul found a young believer named Timothy and took Timothy with him to share the gospel in many places. Later, Paul wrote to Timothy that he should train faithful men in the churches to find other younger Christians to train. Read 2 Timothy 2:2. Jesus to Barnabas to Paul to Timothy to faithful men to other younger Christians. All Christians are called to train trainers who can train trainers to train others. In this way the gospel spreads rapidly!</span></p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p><span class="up">After Jesus was raised from the dead, He continued teaching His disciples about God’s Kingdom. During His last meeting with them, He reinforced the mission they were being called to and about the help that would be provided to them.</span></p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p><span class="up">Read or <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/book-of-acts.html/jesus-taken-up-into-heaven/english.html" target="_blank">watch</a> <strong>Acts 1:1-8</strong> two times as everyone listens</span></p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">To follow Jesus means that we will obey His command to be His witnesses. But we can only do what is needed with the help of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Only as He empowers us, can we be effective witnesses. God’s desire is that we witness to everyone--those like us and those not like us; those near to us and those who live all over the world.</p>
