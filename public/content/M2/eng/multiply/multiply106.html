<p class="back">God has given us every spiritual blessing through Jesus. He has adopted us into His family and calls us His children. “You were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance.” (Ephesians 3:13-14a) What an amazing gift! This is God’s promise for you. </p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">After Jesus’ resurrection, He appeared to His disciples many times during a 40-day period. One of the times He appeared while they were meeting in a large room and He explained the importance of His Word. </p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p class="up">Read or <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/resurrected-jesus-appears/english.html" target="_blank">watch</a> <strong>Luke 24:36-49</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>36 </sup>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”

<p><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.<sup class="versenum">38 </sup>He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?<sup class="versenum">39 </sup>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.<sup class="versenum">41 </sup>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”<sup class="versenum">42 </sup>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,<sup class="versenum">43 </sup>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.<sup class="versenum">46 </sup>He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,<sup class="versenum">47 </sup>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">48 </sup>You are witnesses of these things.<sup class="versenum">49 </sup>I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</p>

	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus wants us to understand God’s Word and what it teaches us about Him. Jesus’ life fulfilled the promises in God’s Word. He wants us to tell others about what we learn. <br />
Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17, Romans 10:17 and Hebrews 4:12 to highlight truths about God’s Word. </p>

<p class="up">Reading the Bible each day is an important part of getting to know Jesus. </p>
