</div>

<h2 class="back">Praise</h2>

<p class="back">Read Psalm 100:2 “Worship the Lord with gladness. Come before Him, singing with joy.” Let’s learn a song we can use to worship the Lord. </p>

<h2 class="back">Caring for each other</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>What is one highlight from this week?</li>
	<li>What is one challenge from this past week?</li>
	<li>What do you want Jesus to do for you this week?</li>
	<li>Pray for each other’s needs.
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Celebrating God's Faithfulness</h2>

<ul class="back">
	<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals and <i>I will</i> statements?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Celebrating God's Faithfulness</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="back">Were you able to tell anyone about your decision to follow Christ?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p class="back">As Jesus went through all the towns and villages, he saw the needs of the people and had compassion on them. He said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field." God wants all people to know him and his love. He wants to use us and He will also raise up more workers from the harvest we will reap. Let’s keep asking God to send more workers to lead people to know Him. </p>

<div class="lesson-subtitle"><span class="up">LOOKING UP</span></div>
</div>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p class="up">Even though Jesus was busy in ministry, he spent a lot of time talking to the Father. As his followers watched him, they too wanted to learn how to talk to the Father. Today we will learn what he told them. </p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p class="up">Read or <a href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/lumo-the-gospel-of-luke.html/lumo-the-gospel-of-luke-11-1-28/english.html" target="_blank">watch</a><strong> Luke 11:1-13</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”

<p><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>He said to them, “When you pray, say:</p>

<div class="poetry top-05">
<p>“‘Father,<br />
hallowed be your name,<br />
your kingdom come.<br />
<sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Give us each day our daily bread.<br />
<sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Forgive us our sins,<br />
    for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.<br />
And lead us not into temptation.’”</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;<sup class="versenum">6 </sup>a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’<sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’<sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.<sup class="versenum">10 </sup>For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?<sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<sup class="versenum">13 </sup>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</p>

<ul class="up">
	<li>What caught your attention (or what did you like best) and why?</li>

<ul class="up">
	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Prayer is simply talking to our heavenly Father. We can use these four points to summarize what Jesus taught: </p>

 <ol class="up">
<li><b>P</b>raise Him and keep Him the center; </li>
<li><b>R</b>equest what you need from Him; </li>
<li><b>A</b>cknowledge your sins; </li>
<li><b>Y</b>ield your life to His will and to His
Kingdom. </li>
</ol>

<p class="up">We can be confident that He hears us and that His heart is to give us good things. </p>

<h2 class="forward">Preparing for the Mission</h2>
<ul class="forward">
	<li>Practice praying using the 4 points of the summary.</li>
	<li>Practice sharing the gospel, about the Holy Spirit, Bible
study, or any previous lesson</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="forward">Going on the Mission</h2>
<ul class="forward">
	<li>Identify 5 people from your Network List with whom you will
tell the story or share the gospel this week.</li>
	<li>Write “I will by when” statements and tell them to your small
group. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="forward">Praying for the Mission</h2>

<ul class="forward">
	<li>Commit everyone's goals to the Lord. Ask the Lord to help us be faithful and use us to start a movement of disciple-makers.</li>
